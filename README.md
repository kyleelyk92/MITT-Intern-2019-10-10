# MITT-Intern-2019-10-10


### This is a version of my term project for the MITT Software Developer program. 

####Objective: This ASP.NET MVC application is built to implement understanding of EntityFramework code-first design.

This intern portal is built to connect MITT students with potential employers. Employers and students build profiles and fill them 
with general information and a few pictures (header, profile photo, etc.). 
Employers can create postings for jobs, and students can then apply to those job postings by emailing the prospective employers.
